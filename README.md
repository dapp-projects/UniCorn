# UniCorn
  A popular safety project
  (1) The Unicorn platform is built on a set of transparent and inclusive intelligent trading system. Realize the decentralized and intelligent economic circulation form, open source the trust risk, and meet the short-term liquidity needs of global users and institutions to be fair, just and open.

Unicorn, which is designed by the London Aslan Blockchain Lab, is a gathering place for the elite of blockchain. The lab designed this model through long-term exploration in the field of blockchain. In today's world, blockchain technology faces the same situation as it did after the invention of electricity in history. The technology is mature, but applications are few and far between. Successful cases are even more rare, let alone killer applications. ASLA Blockchain Lab, for the application of blockchain technology, carries out research, development and promotion work, with the goal of promoting the application of blockchain technology.

Unicorn is the world's first decentralized intelligent trading platform. It is an updated and iterative product of the traditional blockchain exchange, just like the traditional mobile phone and smart phone, which has a large span of upgrading. It avoids some of the drawbacks of traditional trading platforms, such as:

A: The platform is centralized, requiring long-term tracking, uncontrollable boom and slump, high risk, complex operation, long and unstable profit time, manual audit for withdrawal, and long period of account arrival. B: Optimized and upgraded: the platform is fully decentralized, accessible in any browser, free of human intervention, free of transaction, low risk coefficient, controllable risk and high return, and the smart contract withdrawal can be delivered to the account within seconds.

Unicorn means to be the leader of the whole decentralized finance.

(II) The Unicorn system operation has been upgraded in all aspects:

A: The traditional dApp needs to rely on the dApp browser built into the traditional decentralized wallet to access the contract system. Only through the decentralized wallet address can the contract wallet address be interactively linked to trigger the contract execution task.

Ordinary browsers log in the contract system, and the contract system cannot recognize the contract because there is no wallet address, so the contract system cannot directly interact with the link to trigger the contract holder task.

B. We have optimized and upgraded the interactive link between the dApp wallet address and the contract address as well as the operability of the platform.

C. No other wallet address can trigger the contract code to complete your task in place of your wallet address. The contract code runs independently on the blockchain and can only use your wallet address to interact with the node server for information, so the contract system is in operation

Achieve zero feedback with zero failure.

D. Accidental disappearance of the contract system creation team: After the release of the system contract code, the accidental disappearance of the creation team will not affect the automatic execution of the contract code. The logical design of the contract code is completely decentralized, and the users have the right to vote collectively, so the loss of the creator will not affect the operation of the system, similar to the Bitcoin system.

E. In the operation plate of DEFI, the system uses API to obtain the K-line data of BTC, the world's three largest blockchain exchanges, such as Coinbase Pro, Bincanet, Huobi Global Station, to ensure the security of the data and achieve fairness, justice and openness at the same time.

(3) Unicorn operation mode:

In this distributed system, there is no central institution to fully realize decentralized global circulation and intelligent return.

All participants do not need to register and do not need to withdraw. Just bind their own USDT (TRC20) wallet address, you can carry out the global circulation of funds and intelligent return.

(IV) Advantages of Unicorn:

A. Truly decentralized circulation, distributed finance, all the rules are all on the chain, can never be tampered with. B. Any amount can be freely circulated and returned, even as little as 0.0001USDT can be recorded in the blockchain ledger. C. All capital flows and returns are automatically executed by the smart contract without human intervention. D. All data are open and transparent, and participants can choose freely and flexibly. E. Wallet address is your account, without any personal information, to protect personal privacy. F. The web side is only the data display port on the chain. Even if it is attacked by Doss, it cannot be opened in a short time, but the data is written on the chain and is centralized, which can never be changed by external attacks.
